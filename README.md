Excellent video about branchless code: https://youtu.be/bVJ-mWWL7cE?si=tWf4sfdGUZgj9Ik2

This is an exercise on how I would write the function at the end of the video in [Portable SIMD](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/simd/index.html).

This [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) script takes an input string slice and outputs a String where all the characters from `a` to `z` are converted to uppercase.
